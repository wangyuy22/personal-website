Hi, I'm Yuyang! 

I grew up in the Philippines and I'm a Junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS).

NETS is an interdisciplinary major that explores the application of CS to real-world network systems. Alongisde my major, I'm  also pursuing minors in Data Science and Mathematics. 

In the past two summers, I've worked at two amazing tech startups in Southeast Asia – as a Data Science Intern and Product Management Intern respectively – and I hope to continue my journey in learning more about how technology is used in today's world.
