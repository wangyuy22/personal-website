## Summary

The Health Donor app has two components: a web app and an Android app. The web app allows for healthcare providers such as hospitals to create accounts and create donation postings for resources they may need. The mobile app is for users to view these donation postings and donate to those that they are able to.

The web app is built using **NodeJS** and **ExpressEJS**, while we used **Java** and **Android Studio** to create the mobile app. Both apps are connected to a common **MongoDB** backend, and they communicate through API calls.

For this project, I worked in a team of four, with three other programmers and one product manager. We followed an agile software development approach, with user stories, weekly meetings, etc. We also heavily relied on version control through GitHub.
