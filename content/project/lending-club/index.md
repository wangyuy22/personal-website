## Summary

Analysis on Lending Club while also testing different machine learning techniques to produce models that predict the likelihood for someone to repay their loan. Created both a logistic regression model and a classification tree to assess and compare their performances on the data set.

## What I Learned/Gained
* Experience in conducting EDA 
* Exposure to logistic regression model and classification tree

## Languages and Frameworks
* R
