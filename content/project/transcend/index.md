## Summary

R script analysis of SD card manufacturers on Amazon in order to derive insights on which are the most successful competitors of Transcend (a Taiwanese SD card manufacturer). Moreover, I analyze the reviews of these products to derive insights on the most commonly used terms. Created metrics to support regression models that predict the helpfulness of any given review by a user through various indicators.

## What I Learned/Gained
* Experience creating and justifying metrics
* Experience in training basic regression models

## Languages and Frameworks
* R
