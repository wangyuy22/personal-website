## Summary

Through web scraping Yelp data on 200+ hair salons and barber shops in Philadelphia, I hope to answer various questions that newcomers to the city may have regarding hair salons / barber shops. Through various metrics, I determine which shops are the best / worst in terms of quality, value-for-money, etc.
