## Summary

R script that uses data on rodent activity in New York City to analyze various aspects of the rodent infestation that persists within the city. In particular, I look at the activity and frequency of rodent problems across the 5 different areas within NYC and also how events such as Hurricane Sandy affect the number of reported rodent-related issues.

## What I Learned/Gained
* Experience in conducting EDA
* Basic data manipulation and visualization in R

## Languages and Frameworks
* R
